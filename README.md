Find Peak Element in an Array
A Java program to find a peak element in an array using the binary search algorithm. A peak element is an element that is greater than or equal to its neighbors. This program is efficient with a time complexity of O(log n) and handles various edge cases.

Features
Efficient binary search-based approach.
Handles edge cases: single-element arrays, multiple peaks, and boundary conditions.
User-friendly and interactive input for array size and elements.

Input:
Enter the size of array: 6
Enter the elements of array:
1 3 20 4 1 0

Output:
Peak index is 2
Peak element is 20

Requirements
Java 8 or higher installed on your system.
IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or terminal to run the program.
